                        <h2>What is Compounding?</h2>
                        <p><span>Compounding is the preparation of customized medications.</span></p>
                        <p>Compounding makes it easier for patients to receive the ideal medication for their needs and preferences. Compounding is the preparation of customized medications. Compounded medications are made based on a practitioner’s prescription in which individual ingredients are mixed together in the exact strength and dosage form required by the patient.</p>
                        <p>Compounding pharmacists work together with both prescribers and their patients to develop the most appropriate therapy for each person.</p>
                        <p>Our Pharmacist have are trained and certified to prepare unique medications that are tailored to your needs. With our state of the art equipment and facilities we’re able to compound your medication right here while you wait.</p>
                        <p>Examples of our compounding solutions:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Compounding your medication into a lollipop or liquid form and adding your favourite flavour to make it easier to take.</li>
                            <li>Compounding your medication to exclude a particular ingredient that you may be allergic to.</li>
                            <li>Compounding your medication to adjust dosages to ones that may be for suitable for you.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Can all pharmacies compound? No, Compounding requires specialized equipment and chemicals that are not available in most pharmacies. Compounding pharmacists must undergo extensive training in modern compounding techniques and attend continuing education seminars regularly.</p>
                        <p>Certified by the Professional Compounding Centres of America, we are one of the few compounding facilities in South Western Ontario that is licensed and equipped to develop custom medications on site.</p>

                        <p>The flu is not always a harmless illness. It is a contagious viral infection that can cause serious health issues, including death, to those that are susceptible. Posing the greatest risk to very young children, seniors over the age of 65, and those with chronic medical conditions, the flu has the potential to affect even the healthy.</p>
                        <p>The flu shot is an inactivated vaccine, containing killed virus, and is usually administered by a needle in the arm. Nasal sprays are now available as an alternative to the needle. Flu vaccines are constantly changing, and it is important to keep yourself protected by getting vaccinated every influenza season.</p>
                        <p>Amhersrtburg Pharmacy Compounding & Wellness is licensed and equipped to administer the flu shot as well as other vaccines upon request. To get your shot, simply call us today to book an appointment.</p>

                        <p>MD Connected seeks to capitalize on the evolution of technology to offer Canadians healthcare they can rely on in a more timely and efficient manner.</p>
                        <p>Many Canadians reside in remote communities that are currently under-served by medical practitioners. We do not believe that physical location should diminish accessibility to healthcare providers. Our goal is to serve all Canadian patients by connecting them to a network of medical practitioners through advanced telemedicine technologies.</p>
                        <p>Many Canadians face extended wait times due to a significant population without a family physician; resulting in an influx to the hospital emergency rooms for basic medical needs. MD Connected looks to offer medical services through walk-in clinics and flexible hours to serve these patients.</p>
                        <p>MD Connected treat a variety of conditions, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allergies</li>
